# Disney Trip Planner - JS Project

Hello, this is my JavaScript project! It's a simple app that allows you to plan out a trip to Walt Disney World.

## Usage

My project allows you to build a trip to Disney, add days to it, and make plans for each day. For example, you could make a plan to go to Casey’s Corner at Magic Kingdom for lunch, or schedule a FastPass for Peter Pan’s Flight in the evening, or any combination of restaurants and/or attractions! Also, you can load and view previously made trips.

## Installation

After you fork this repo, cd into `/disney_trip_api` and run

```bundle```

to load the dependencies. Then run

```rails db:migrate```

and

```rails db:seed```

to initialize the database and seed the restaurants and attractions.

To start the app, open `index.html` and enjoy!
